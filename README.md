# Introduction:
In this notebook I will try to harness the power of sklearn's NLP capabilities.

In the first part of the notebok I will use a Naive Bayes algorithm to try to classify a dataset comprised of sentences
from 5 different languages: English,Italian,Spanish,Dutch, Deutsch

In the second part I will try to classify a list of Nicknames and assign them a predicted Gender.

I will attach the datasets and text files i've used in this notebook.
But I will also attach the source website I've gotten them from:
